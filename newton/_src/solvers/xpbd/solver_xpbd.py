    """An implicit integrator using eXtended Position-Based Dynamics (XPBD) for rigid and soft body simulation.

    After constructing :class:`Model`, :class:`State`, and :class:`Control` (optional) objects, this time-integrator
    may be used to advance the simulation state forward in time.

    Limitations:
        **Momentum conservation** -- When ``rigid_contact_con_weighting`` is
        enabled (the default), each body's positional correction is divided by
        its number of active contacts.  This improves convergence for stacking
        scenarios but means the solver does not conserve momentum at contacts.
        Reported per-contact forces (see :meth:`update_contacts`) are
        approximate: for contacts between two dynamic bodies the force is
        computed using the harmonic mean of the two bodies' contact counts,
        which is symmetric but not exact.

        **Reported parent-joint forces** (see :attr:`~newton.State.body_parent_f`,
        populated when the extended state attribute is requested) are
        approximate.  XPBD applies relaxation factors
        (``joint_linear_relaxation``, ``joint_angular_relaxation``) to each
        joint constraint correction, and with a finite ``iterations`` count
        residual constraint error remains at end-of-step, so the reported
        wrench is the *applied* constraint reaction rather than the exact
        wrench needed to enforce the joint perfectly.  The convention matches
        :class:`~newton.solvers.SolverFeatherstone` and
        :class:`~newton.solvers.SolverMuJoCo`: it is the spatial wrench
        transmitted from the parent through the inbound joint, in world frame
        at the child body's COM, **including** both the constraint reaction
        and the body-frame contribution of :attr:`~newton.Control.joint_f`.
        In equilibrium this wrench counters all applied forces (gravity,
        contacts, ``State.body_f``) by Newton's third law.

    Joint limitations:
        - Supported joint types: PRISMATIC, REVOLUTE, BALL, FIXED, FREE, DISTANCE, D6.
          CABLE joints are not supported.
        - :attr:`~newton.Model.joint_enabled`,
          :attr:`~newton.Model.joint_target_ke`/:attr:`~newton.Model.joint_target_kd`, and
          :attr:`~newton.Control.joint_f` are supported.
          Joint limits are enforced as hard positional constraints (``joint_limit_ke``/``joint_limit_kd`` are not used).
        - :attr:`~newton.Model.joint_armature`, :attr:`~newton.Model.joint_friction`,
          :attr:`~newton.Model.joint_effort_limit`, :attr:`~newton.Model.joint_velocity_limit`,
          and :attr:`~newton.Model.joint_target_mode` are not supported.
        - Equality and mimic constraints are not supported.

        See :ref:`Joint feature support` for the full comparison across solvers.

    Fluids:
        Particles flagged with :attr:`newton.ParticleFlags.FLUID` are simulated
        as a position-based fluid (Macklin & Müller, "Position Based Fluids",
        2013): instead of pairwise contact constraints, fluid particle pairs
        generate SPH density constraints that are solved inside the regular
        XPBD iteration loop, so fluids two-way couple with rigid bodies, cloth,
        and soft bodies. Unlike a fixed-bounds SPH solver, fluid particles are
        free to travel anywhere and collide with shapes through the standard
        particle contact pipeline. A bounded cohesion term (``fluid_cohesion``)
        makes splashes coagulate into strands and droplets instead of dispersing
        into isolated particles; XSPH viscosity and vorticity confinement act on
        velocities after the position solve.

        An optional render-only foam/spray layer (``max_diffuse_particles``)
        spawns Flex-style diffuse particles from a trapped-air/wave-crest
        potential over the fluid surface. The results in
        :attr:`diffuse_positions` and :attr:`diffuse_velocities` can be passed
        to ``Viewer.log_fluid_diffuse()``.

        Args:
            model: Model to simulate.
            iterations: Number of XPBD constraint iterations per step.
            soft_body_relaxation: Relaxation factor for soft body (FEM) constraints.
            soft_contact_relaxation: Relaxation factor for particle contact constraints.
            joint_linear_relaxation: Relaxation factor for linear joint corrections.
            joint_angular_relaxation: Relaxation factor for angular joint corrections.
            joint_linear_compliance: Compliance of linear joint constraints [m/N].
            joint_angular_compliance: Compliance of angular joint constraints [rad/(N·m)].
            rigid_contact_relaxation: Relaxation factor for rigid contact constraints.
            rigid_contact_con_weighting: Whether to divide rigid contact corrections by the
                number of active contacts per body.
            angular_damping: Angular damping coefficient applied during body integration.
            enable_restitution: Whether to apply restitution at contacts.
            fluid_rest_distance: Rest spacing between fluid particles [m]. If ``None``,
                twice the maximum particle radius is used (touching spheres). Particles
                spawned on a grid with this spacing are exactly at rest density.
            fluid_smoothing_length: SPH kernel support radius [m]. If ``None``,
                ``1.8 * fluid_rest_distance`` is used, mirroring the rest-distance to
                interaction-radius ratio used by Flex fluids.
            fluid_rest_density: Fluid rest density [kg/m³]. If ``None``, it is calibrated
                from the mean fluid particle mass so that a regular grid of particles at
                ``fluid_rest_distance`` spacing is exactly at rest.
            fluid_cohesion: How strongly the fluid holds together, in ``[0, 1]``.
                Scales a bounded Akinci-style cohesion term that attracts neighbors
                at mid-range and repels at short range, producing surface-tension-like
                coagulation of splashes into droplets and strands. ``0`` disables
                cohesion so splashes disperse into individual particles.
            fluid_viscosity: XSPH viscosity in ``[0, 1]``: per-substep blend toward the
                kernel-weighted neighborhood velocity. Small values (``0.01``-``0.1``)
                suit water; values near ``1`` give honey-like behavior.
            fluid_vorticity_confinement: Vorticity confinement strength that re-injects
                rotational motion lost to the position solve. ``0`` disables it.
            fluid_relaxation: Per-iteration scale on fluid density corrections.
            fluid_max_neighbors: Cap on the neighbors each fluid particle processes
                in the density solve. ``0`` (default) processes all neighbors; a
                positive value bounds the per-particle cost so a momentary
                over-compressed clump cannot stall its whole warp. Set it above
                the bulk neighbor count (so the rest state is never truncated and
                stays consistent with the rest-density calibration).
            body_max_velocity: Per-substep cap on dynamic-body linear speed [m/s].
                ``0`` (default) disables it. A small positive value prevents a
                body slammed into deep penetration from receiving a divergent
                correction velocity that tunnels and blows up to NaN.
            body_max_angular_velocity: Per-substep cap on dynamic-body angular
                speed [rad/s]. ``0`` (default) disables it.
            max_diffuse_particles: Maximum secondary foam/spray particles. Set to
                ``0`` (default) to disable the diffuse particle layer. When enabled,
                foam state is written to :attr:`diffuse_positions` and
                :attr:`diffuse_velocities`, which can be passed to
                ``Viewer.log_fluid_diffuse()``.
            diffuse_threshold: Trapped-air/wave-crest potential needed to emit a
                diffuse particle. The potential favors surface particles whose
                neighborhood is rapidly compressing or cresting.
            diffuse_lifetime: Diffuse particle lifetime [s].
            diffuse_drag: Blend rate toward neighboring fluid velocity [1/s].
            diffuse_buoyancy: Fraction of gravity canceled while a diffuse
                particle has fluid neighbors.
            diffuse_ballistic: Neighbor count below which a diffuse particle falls
                ballistically (spray) instead of advecting with the fluid (foam).
            diffuse_spawn_probability: Per-step spawn probability multiplier once
                the diffuse potential exceeds ``diffuse_threshold``.
            diffuse_jitter: Spawn offset radius [m]. If ``None``, a fraction of the
                fluid smoothing length is used.
            diffuse_surface_density_ratio: Density threshold used to classify
                surface particles as diffuse emitters.
            diffuse_shape_collision: Whether diffuse particles collide with shapes.

        Both force [N] and torque [N·m] components are written.  The torque
        includes torsional and rolling friction contributions that cannot be
        reconstructed from the linear force alone.

        When ``rigid_contact_con_weighting`` is enabled, the raw per-contact
        impulse is scaled to reflect the ``1/N`` correction that
        ``apply_body_deltas`` applies.  For contacts between a dynamic and a
        kinematic body, ``N`` is the dynamic body's contact count.  For
        contacts between two dynamic bodies, the harmonic mean
        ``2/(N_a + N_b)`` is used so that the reported force is symmetric with
        respect to body ordering.  This is an approximation -- the solver
        applies ``1/N_a`` and ``1/N_b`` independently to each side, so no
        single scalar can exactly represent both.
